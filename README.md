# QAFormatter

## Installing JAVA

You need to install Java. It will help you to run the program on your device. Go to [this site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-windows) and chose preferred platform. I recommend you to download **.exe** installer as it will do everything automatically. The installation pass should look similar to this **(JDK version 18+)**.
