Are there advantages to single-sex schooling?
Introduction
Gender mainstreaming has become a global concern with regard to a society that is viewed to be patriarchal. Therefore, it is not apparent that gender segregation exists. One of the obvious forms of gender segregation is the creation of single-sex schooling (Wong, 2018). Single-sex schooling is an alternative to mixed-gender schooling or co-educational. Single-sex schooling has been discussed by several educationists to be a matter of school effectiveness, gender equality of educational opportunities, and free educational choices (Koniewski, 2012). Therefore, the practice has explained that such a mode of study may increase student gender salience, minimises opportunities for mixed-gender interactions, and increase mixed-gender anxiety, little evidence has been found to substantiate the claims.
Background of the essay
In the recent past, human cohesion and reintegration have been a major concern due to previous racial segregation which gave birth to the fight for women’s rights, social justice, and equal rights among others. Education was a ground of racial segregation and discrimination. It has taken both a physical and legal battle to help overcome it. Education is a key factor in helping bring equilibrium to society. Both males and females are to get equal education which is not the case, several scholars have theorised factors that may lead to poor performance of students within the school set up. It is now apparent that my discussion circumnavigates the pertinent issue with regard to the schooling system. The Education system has been twofold involving both single-sex schooling and education. I am resonating my point on the significance of single-sex schooling in the subsequent writing with relevant literature reviews to substitute my point that indeed single-sex schooling has advantages.
Schooling experience is meant to positively impact the learners through psychosocial development. The key characteristics that sum up the differences between single-sex schooling and coeducational schooling are the presence or the absence of the opposite gender (Wong, 2018). The question of whether single-sex schooling is advantageous depends on examining numerous aspects of school set up which involves asking questions. Wong (2018) propounds that, it is crucial to understand whether examining gender looms larger in single-sex school students? Whether single-sex school students more anxious than coeducational school students when they interact with other-gender peers? If so, is such increased anxiety related to the increased salience of gender or simply to reduced mixed-gender experience?
Kocak (2019) explains that in single-sex schooling, students will not have worries about their personal appearance, fear of making mistakes, and intentions to impress students of the opposite sex. This will amount that most of the time will be used in grasping educational concepts leading to less distraction and less stress hence, improved positive academic improvement. Kocaks argues that it is undeniable that, in sciences classes, the girls in single-sex schooling demonstrate better performance through participation and showing keen interest. And on the flip side, boys in single-sex schooling are more apt to participate in areas where emotions are expressed such as in the area of fine arts; including drama or music which is not much possible for boys to express themselves through art in front of the opposite gender.
In response to the main topic, addressing this question is fundamentally crucial that, mixed-gender interaction is inevitable in forming positive mixed-gender relationships for positive human growth and development (Wong, 2018). The available studies continue to castigate the outcomes relating to single-sex schooling and coeducational school on the merits of social-economic status failing to address the keys aspects of the salience of gender knowledge and mixed-gender anxiety.
Literature Review
Even though certain scholars have different opinions with regards to the effects of single-sex schooling as compared to coed schooling. Jackson (2021) aimed at identifying the effects of the transition from both sides of the divide. The comparison was based on students who attended the same secondary school under mixed-gender schooling and the student at single-sex schooling. The perspectives explore the students who prefer to attend a given secondary school, there was an entry score above where the successful student will be admitted while the unsuccessful would be cut off. This is the first evaluation of a large-scale policy to introduce single-sex education into existing coed schools. Jackson indicated that the results reveal that this policy can be a low-cost way to improve academic and non-academic outcomes for low-achieving students. Single-sex schooling continues to give positive impacts on the student’s psychosocial development (Kocak, 2019)
As a matter of measure to improve student performance in schools, single-sex schooling has gained significant approval among the stakeholders in Uk by expanding gender homogenous schools with an aim of raising the educational standards of both boys and girls (Giardili, 2019). Moreover, there is little evidence to ascertain that attending single-sex schooling improves student educational performance. Kocak (2019) supported the opinion that single-sex schooling is a low-cost method of improving education. Giardili (2019) also expounds his view on the cost of implementation to be more attractive.
Even though the concept of single-sex schooling is not new, the reasoning behind is. The think tanks of single-sex schooling argue that single-gender schools increase the student’s outcomes by addressing their needs in line with gender specificity, improving classroom behaviour, and curbing gender stereotyping. Due to insufficient studies on single-sex schooling, the available information based on high school and university students leaves behind a crucial part of the early school stages where this practice will be much more relevant and beneficial (Giardili, 2019). 
According to Wong (2018), Gender salience is the awareness of gender as a categorising dimension. It is important for the growth and development of children in the early stages since children always use gender identity to process incoming information. High gender salience may have an impact on the psychosocial development of an individual (Wong 2018). The empirical evidence of single-sex schooling for adolescents or young adults may not be beneficial for students at early stages. Early and middle early childhood are key stages of an individual physical and cognitive development (Giardili, 2019). This is the period where children embrace new habits and social gender roles hence gender gaps are realised.
Like other emerging perspectives, single-sex education is viewed as gender segregation. With no absolute linkages that single-sex schooling is better than other forms of formal schooling. Schools are considered primary socialising institutions. Several research is being conducted to help students realise their full potential (Van Hek, 2018). The education system has been marked by inequalities across socioeconomics and race. Van (2018) has propounded that recent researches focus on why girls perform better than boys in all spheres of the education fabric. Therefore, it is fundamental that we consider the primary role of school before focusing on the forms of school as a socialising agent where students learn and interact with their fellows and gain basic life skills.
Whether single-sex schooling or mixed schooling, schools are designed to meet the psychological needs that are found within the relationship between the student’s sense of school belongings and the students’ motivational, social-emotional behavioural, and academic functioning (Korpershoek, 2018). The much-debated concept of whether single-sex schooling or co-educational produces greater gender salience. Basing my investigation of developmental intergroup theory, gender, as an identity become more accessible to the person under four factors (Wong 2018) these factors are not subject to students’ inherent well beings but perception instilled in them first when a group feels discriminated against based on a given environment secondly when a group feels segregated and in minority third when a group feels labelled to behave or act in a particular way finally when a group feels be used as compared to another existing group.
Since single-sex schooling possesses both the features of decreased and increased gender salience, it seems obvious that its advantages are not conclusive. Several scholars have mixed views on the effects of single-sex schooling. Van Hek (2018) mentioned that students are affected differently. Education parameters continue to gain both support and counter-opinion alike. It is therefore time, to sum up, most of the view that gives the absolute reasons as to why some stakeholders would prefer to choose one parameter against the other.
Reasons for coeducation are that both boys and girls are uniquely different these are supported by physical, mental, biological, and psychological aspects therefore, religious concepts of single-sex schooling no longer fit and aim at gender segregation in the already segregated world. The world is diverse; it is an outdated belief that having both genders in the same classroom will negatively affect their development. It is also apparent that single-sex schooling negatively promotes gender stereotyping by prohibiting both boys and girls to have positive socialisation in the early stages hence increasing the patriarchal society once they depart from educational setups. This inculcates both genders as different leading to viewing the opposite sex as foreign or inferior hence inevitable disrespect that creates the gap in the society.
There is an actual disagreement among the students in single-sex schooling. There is a developed mentality that a particular gender has a unique pattern of responding therefore, the nonconforming boys or girls in single-sexes are bullied due to their nonconformity. In contrast, Co-education accommodates all genders and offers a sense of protection to these students because of the presence of diversity.
Schools are crucial in the socialisation context of children’s life (Van Hek,2018). In recent studies, different scholars have established that the single-sex education system has got a significant impact on the life of students. I continue to explore different scholarly works based on the advantages of single-sex schooling as it creates an opportunity due to the allocation of resources specifically for a specific gender. It encourages open discussion that may be limited in coeducation leading to positive class participation.
Single-sex schooling gives an ambient environment where students are free from pressure emanating from the opposite gender, this makes them excel academically. It acts as a safe haven where self-awareness, refraining from billing and encourages family participation in economic empowerment since they exercise how to be independent and make their own life at early stages.
Even though single-sex schooling experienced impediments in its execution in the previous years, limitation clauses were enacted to cater to the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. In 1972, Education Amendment prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally-funded education program or activity (Benham, 2019). Even Equal protection clause was enacted, several single-sex schooling has thrived and in fact, many single-sex educations have been created.
To be able to show that single-sex schooling has advantages as compared to the coeducation methods. The discussion has to be sensitive to cover fundamental issues which have raised eyes brows in the previous year. Benham et al. (2019) has propounded that while many stakeholders including students and parents have welcomed single-sex educational opportunities, scholars and civil rights groups such as the National Organisation for Women (“NOW”), the American Civil Liberties Union (“ACLU”), and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (“NAACP”) believe that the separation of the sexes in education undermines the fight for gender equality. As a result, these groups have voiced strong opposition to the expansion of single-sex education.
As many educational scholars have put it, education is the equaliser. They continue to believe that, a particular kind of education parameter is able to transform individual society into a mode of social justice (Wengronowitz, 2020). He continues to explain that, many gatekeepers are in the unanimous opinion that every educational setup has its unique style for the same mission. The cardinal reason for deciding and making a choice school for both schoolings is the respective parameter of educational set-up for professional success and academic excellence.
The co-educational school is the norm in most parts of the world in both public and private institutions, and they are often associated with many advantages for psychosocial and emotional well beings to student development as they give a number of real-world social interactions. For example, many workplaces and most public spaces are co-education. Wengronowitz (2020), explained that there is also some belief among researchers and non-scholars, alike, that students learn cross-gender socialisation in a co-ed school.
In addition, co-ed schooling is the proud result of activists who fought for girls and boys to have access to the same facilities and same courses, which some activists and scholars believe to be equitable (Wengronowitz, 2020). Even though there are counter-argument that claim females who receive single-sex schooling may experience difficulties when engaging socially with individuals of the opposite sex when entering a tertiary education environment (James, 2020). The research continues to expound on the aspects of single-sex schooling vis-a-vis coeducation. Individual interaction is a psychological triggered (Korpershoek, 2018). The fundamental aspects of psychology are discussed to explain the scenario and come up with an absolute reason for the benefit of single-sex schooling.
Theoretical argument and how it helps in understanding the issue
The most relevant perspective in debunking the advantages of single-sex schooling is s Lev Vygotsky’s Social Constructivist Theory (James, 2020). It gives us concepts that thoughts develop and adapt from society which then influences the individual (James, 2020). The second major concept is cognitive development which is a consequence of certain extrinsic factors such as social interaction (instead of individual formation or construction), historical factors, and cultural or contextual factors (James, 2020). It continues to explain that psychological tools, particularly language, allow individuals to learn certain appropriate behaviour. James (2020) put it that sociologist explains that cognitive developments are experienced within an individual social level. Understanding people involve occurrences of circumstances within their environment and their social surroundings and interaction.
Social Constructivist Theory
This is important in the sense that, it allows one to predict the behaviour and mannerisms an individual learns and acquires based on their environment and the people they interact with. This theory contributes to the understanding of the chosen research problem because it highlights the fact that individuals learn certain behaviours based on interaction with others (James 2020). This theory explained that if an individual attends single-sex schooling they may not experience difficulties in interacting with the opposite gender since individual perceptions are learned socially and there are several agents of socialisation where schools are just being one.
This is coined in the fact that primary socialisation starts from a family which acts as a guide and teaches a child how to deal with life matters (Chandio, 2019). Therefore, parents’ and peer groups’ agents change the children’s way of doing things deeply (Chandio, 2019). Hence, Primary socialisation agents are the primary source that affects an individual future life. 
Chandio (2019) explains that culture and norms learned by children are the cardinal influence of the primary socialisation that is based on the different levels of bonds in the relationship between youth and social interaction in society. The parental role is a significant factor that helps a child develops a personality via social, moral, economic, psychological, and health-related support. The most powerful agent of socialisation is the family which allows the development of a sound personality and healthy growth of the child in the sphere of physical, metaphysical, psychological, emotional, and economic institutions.
Benham (2019) through the enacted Acts claims that participation in single-sex classes must be voluntary. Thereby, to ensure voluntary participation, learning institutions must provide a reasonable equal coeducational class for every single-sex class, because students’ enrollment in a single-sex class may not be deemed to be voluntary. Significant equality does not require classes to be identical in nature. Rather, in determining whether classes are reasonably uniform. The continued support for single-sex education continues to bring new energy in support of this concept in that, both boys and girls learned differently. Benham continues to explain that social relations in the classroom may escalate distractions caused by members of the opposite sex and subtle differences in the way that boys and girls are treated in co-educational settings.
The most gigantic point rest in the idea that parents should have diverse options when deciding which educational parameters to utilise. Some supporters of single-sex schools argue that girls and boys learn differently. They point out that male and female brains develop in different patterns and, therefore, that separating boys from girls allows educators to teach more effectively to each group (Benham, 2019). Single-sex education can improve student achievement and educational attainment. Thereby to have a complete grasp of the nature and impact of same-gender learning environments must be provided to accommodate such policy (Giardili, 2019). It is, therefore, concepts that have got mixed perceptions where policy implementation must be sensitive to cover all the rudimentary beliefs. It should address issues of gender segregation and address the students’ emotional and psychodynamic developments. 
From the given topic, several kinds of literature have expounded on the available sources that contrast the two concepts of education where the single-sex schooling demands robust and thorough inquiry to get the deeper significance of single-sex education, it is relevant to examine the performance of the student’s psychosocial developments among other issues, therefore more research is needed to debunk the positive side of single-sex schooling.
Methodology
I begin by assessing the two concepts of schooling. My primary role is invested in the advantages of single-sex schooling. This essay aimed at filling the gap in misinformation that surrounds single-sex education. In this research, the paradigm shifted in the positivity of single-sex schooling due to the fact that the results are factual and verifiable (James, 2020). A quantitative research method is used in this case to help generate data that can be utilised in usable statistics. it is very significant in accepting or rejecting the hypothesis, it reduces biases at the same time increase validity and reliability (James, 2020). It is very significant in considering the language in the design of the questions to avoid any prejudiced, persuasive outcome.
As best practices dictate, qualitative methodology gives an exploration of time and space-bound phenomena (Alpi, 2019), it requires more from the authors who act as an instrument in the inquiry process. Due to the nature of this research, I will utilise both qualitative and quantitative research in order to refute or accept the null hypothesis and answer the min question of whether single-sex schooling is a positive thing (James, 2020), where research strategy will be experimental between the two policies to single-sex schooling and the coeducation and the gender aspects of it.
Ethical consideration
Primarily, I must adhere to all codes of best practices and ethical concerns must be at stake with reference to the British Educational Research Association (BERA). It is always important to obtain the consent of both the participant and their guardians to ensure legal authorisation to obtain information. I will do this by giving an explanation to the gatekeepers such as the school heads, policy implementers, and the participants giving detail of the reason for the research and why I need their participation, this will give a sense of transparency and trust to the stakeholders (Mukherji et al., 2018, p.111). It is also important to use appropriate technology for the grantee’s data privacy and protection as highlighted by the national data protection agencies (Bera.ac.uk, 2018). Questions and language used should always be simple and appropriate.
Finally, research being an important practice that is used in decided best practices and policy formulation, it is crucial that I follow the laydown principles in the field of research which includes the Data Protection Acts (2018), Understanding the local dynamics, and getting conversant with the contentious issue relating to confidentiality and anonymity (British Psychological Society, 2018). It is also important that the researcher use the close-ended questionnaire to avoid manipulation of results to fit specific agenda, the research should not be harmful to the participant.
Conclusion
The paper aimed at examining current literature in the field of advantages of single-sex schooling. By comparing different literature reviews, it is evident that there is a huge gap that exists in the current beliefs between coeducation and single-sex schooling. Single-sex schooling is an area of concern that continue to attract scholars and non-educationist alike. The prevailing studies pertain to the conceptual framework model testing the advantages of single-sex schooling. This can be attained through empirical means where current conditions of children’s development rely on stable social institutions (Chandio, 2019). It is no doubt that human interaction and performance are influenced.
It can be concluded that single-sex students who already graduated have demonstrated better academic achievement compared to the ones in coeducation due to non-destruction from the opposite gender. It is argued that single-sex schooling provides a better platform for female students to opt for so-called male subjects such as engineering, science, and mathematics, and is believed to lead to better academic performance (Kocak, 2019). It is therefore away from misinformation that single-sex education is gender segregation, it poses significant benefits to the student, reducing the level of destruction in the learning environment, and encourages self-awareness by encouraging open discussion among the student of same-sex.
