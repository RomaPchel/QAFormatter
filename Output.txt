Introduction
One of the most difficult tasks as an entrepreneur is coming up with a new business idea. The process is time-consuming and requires resources that are usually not available primarily when starting from scratch (Berger et al., 2021 p.440). With the use of technology and the unmet customer needs, it is possible to identify a gap in the market and come up with a new idea to satisfy the customers. The venture that is discussed in this paper is a water vendor. Water is a basic need that is not available in most rural areas. Several concepts are addressed, including the framework for a new venture, the business possibility for success, and a reflection of the learning.
The framework used to develop the idea
Numerous frameworks are used to develop business ideas. One of those frameworks that have been applied in this case is democratisation. This is the process of making products and services that are mostly used by wealthy individuals to be available to the average citizens. This framework makes it possible to develop ideas by looking at the services or goods primarily available in wealthy families but rare to find in ordinary people. Water is a basic need, but most families rely on tap water which is not clean for consumption. Those who belong to rich families buy water from supermarkets or water vendors because they have enough money to take good care of their health. Ordinary families prefer to use tap water and save money for other needs. Thus, making this resource available in rural areas will be a great business opportunity since most water vendors are found in the city. Those living in rural areas rely on rainwater, harvested during the rainy season, and stored for future use. Some use well water, which is not suitable for consumption. Establishing the water vendor in rural areas will ensure people have access to clean water. Also, this will be a good business since it will attract more customers due to low competition.
Lean Canvas Approach
This approach enables entrepreneurs to get ideas out of their heads into tangible formats for easier communication with others. In the past, this process could take weeks or months, but with the lean canvas, it only takes a few hours. This model quickly formulates product launches, variations, and campaigns and communicates with stakeholders for clarifications or comments (Sire et al., 2019 p.95).
Problems
Each of the customer segments has varying problems that this venture will solve. One of the problems is the lack of access to clean water because their location is not easily accessible. The second problem is the lack of enough storage facilities to harvest and store clean rainwater. The third issue is a lack of enough money to buy commodities like clean water.
Solutions
The primary aim of this business will be to provide solutions to the above problems. Supplying clean water will be the best solution for the target population because they lack access to this commodity. The other solution will be accessibility since the vendor will be located in a rural area where customers can rush when they need water.

Customers segments
The target customers will be those living in rural regions with no access to clean water. Another segment will be low-income families who have no storage facilities for clean rainwater. The population will be composed of people with families.
Unique Value Proposition
This is a promise of value that will be delivered to the customers. This will be the reason for customers to buy water. One is because the water will be accessible and at an affordable price. This will be pocket friendly for the target customers from low-income families. The business will provide transportation for those without the means.
Channels
These are the different paths that will be utilised to reach out to the customers (Saulais, 2019 p.93). Since the location is rural, media will be utilised to create awareness among the customers. This implies that TV and radio will be effective in this case. Another channel will be the billboards which will be strategically positioned to attract customers and remind them of the business’s existence. Those with phones will get text messages from time to time.
Revenue streams
Starting this business will require a lot of resources which will be costly. Thus, revenues sources will be considered to have enough capital for the company. One of the sources will be from personal savings, which will be done for a while. The second source that will be very effective is family borrowing, where some relatives will be consulted to lend money. The other source will be to borrow from financial institutions such as banks.
Cost Structure
Several factors will be considered, which include the cost of interviewing customers ($ 100), transport cost ($200), market research ($100), landing space ($500), marketing ($200), and other equipment ($300)
Key Metrics
These will be used to monitor the business performance. The business performance will be monitored by customer and employees satisfaction. Productivity will be another aspect of measuring performance.
Unfair Advantage
This is the most difficult concept that most businesses fail to consider. Not everything will go as planned due to some errors from one thing aspect to another. One of the factors is customer loyalty which will not be a guarantee. Another factor is passion and commitment to the work. 
Evaluation
There are different ways that business success will be measured. One way is by gathering feedback from customers, where different channels can be used when gathering feedback. In this case, the best channel is face-to-face communication, where customers will be asked if they are happy with the product and the services offered. The process can also involve filling out some questions for privacy purposes (Saura et al., 2019 p.917). This way, the client will be free to list some of the things they like and what they would like the business to change. These feedbacks are critical for business success because it will allow the business to identify its weak areas and improve for future success. In the process of interacting with the customers, it will stimulate relationships and royalty. 
Quality assurance will be used to check the quality of the product sold and the services offered. This process will ensure that the business is working according to the standards that have been proposed. Quality is a critical factor when dealing with water since it is consumed directly by the vendor without additives. This means that even the vulnerable population like the young children and patients will consume this water. Thus, quality will be crucial to enhancing customer safety and satisfaction. All the equipment used by the business will be checked regularly to ensure they are effective and in good condition. The process will involve updating any software used to avoid delays or other problems that might impact product delivery and distribution.
Another factor in evaluating the business’s possibility for success is team satisfaction. Working in teams is one of the major components of a successful business. It ensures employees understand the importance of diversity and respect the differences that exist among them in terms of age, gender, race, and education level. Team satisfaction indicates that employees are happy working with each other and love their work (Schrauder et al., 2018 p.410). Being satisfied can be improved by incentives and communication. The executive should be a good listener to create a friendly relationship with the other employees. Other communication skills are vital for team management because they result in respect and understanding. Incentives can be in the form of gifts or promotions. This will motivate employees to work together and achieve the business objectives. There is a good customer-employee relationship because the employees are well treated and satisfied with their job. Team satisfaction involves other stakeholders, such as the suppliers, and shareholders, among other individuals that impact the business performance. All these people play a critical role in the success of a business, and their satisfaction is an indicator of success. For example, when the suppliers are content with the payment and other services, they keep supplying high-quality materials, attracting more customers, and leading to business growth.
Re-evaluating the lean canvas will be vital to ensure its feasibility. Having this approach in place is a good step, but implementation matters the most. All the elements outlined in the lean canvas will be evaluated to see if they are applied accordingly. Identifying the existing problem and providing the solutions outlined will be a good way to determine business success. This is because the business will address the main issues. Other elements, including the channels and revenue, are essential, and this process will ensure that they are put in place. This implies that the company will ensure there are appropriate resources and channels to reach the customers. All of these will lead to customer satisfaction and increased productivity and growth. The cost structure re-evaluation will tell the business what has been accomplished and what is needed. In the process, more money can be raised to boost some activities.
Evaluation of Lean Startup
This approach advocates developing products that customers have already shown interest in, and a market will exist once the product is introduced. There is more to learn about successful entrepreneurship and innovation with this approach. With this model, businesses hire employees who can learn, adapt and work quickly. This is the opposite of the traditional model, where employees are hired based on their experience and abilities (Silva et al., 2020 p.1). This model is an indication that changes are prone to occur from time to time, and the best way to manage those changes is by having workers who can adapt. Adapting to the changes is vital for organisations since employees can work under pressure and deliver their tasks. Another thing to consider with this approach is experimentation which is more valuable than having a detailed planning process. Planning takes an extended period, and the results might not be successful compared to lean startup, which uses a business model based on hypotheses. These hypotheses are tested more often so that in case of no reactions, the model adjusts quickly to limit the losses. The hypotheses are tested by engaging with customers and buyers to gauge their reactions to a given product (Mansoori et al., 2019 p.40). The reaction given is used by entrepreneurs to make minor adjustments. The long-term benefit of using this method is business growth since more focus is on what the customer wants. It saves the company from making losses and leads to customer satisfaction.
There are other critical factors beyond the lean startup approach. One of those factors is persistence. This is the refusal to give up no matter the situation. There is an increased rate of competition in the market, and the best way to have a competitive advantage is through patience. This can result in business success in the long run. Another factor is teamwork. Working as a group makes work easier because there is sharing of ideas and the process of decision-making goes step by step. Where teams are involved, there is diversification, and each person is assigned a role depending on their skills. Knowing and appreciating the differences among employees is critical for business success since there is respect and trust. Teamwork and good leadership will be enhanced for this new venture to increase production and create a good working environment.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this discussion has utilised knowledge and skills gained through the module to generate a new venture, evaluate its possibility for success, and provide a learning reflection. Venturing into a new business can be successful if proper planning is done in the initial stages. The business can point out some of the drawbacks and come up with possible solutions. The entrepreneur's mind is also critical when starting a business because it enables individuals to see beyond the ideas and put things into practice. The primary recommendation is to use the appropriate models to avoid business closure in the early stages.
