Article Summary: “Do Rising Oil Prices Cause Recession?”
The research analyzes a study by Pettinger (2022) on “Do rising oil prices cause recession.” According to Pettinger (2022), increasing oil prices leads to recession in two primary forms. High oil prices can reduce income, which leads to reduced spending, or higher oil prices can increase inflation, leading to an increase of interest rates by the central banks. High-interest rates slow down economic growth as people reduce borrowings and investments for fear of paying high interests and taxes. For instance, the recent increase in oil price due to the Russian conflict with Ukraine, economies fear high cost of living, which may slow down economic growth and development (Pettinger, 2022). Inflation caused by increased oil prices causes a relative increase in prices of produced goods due to high transportation costs. If oil prices rise, the economy will experience cost-push inflation affected by high prices of goods when consumers have lower income, cutting off some expenditure. The Russian-Ukraine war is a political uncertainty that will affect international trade globally. Therefore, business managers will respond with decision-making strategies to maximize profits and reduce losses.
Business managers have a challenge in decision-making for production and pricing that will not affect their customer relationships and even reduce profits. War affects business planning, growth, and transportation of goods and services from producers to consumers. Managers will have to optimize the decision-making processes that will help them maximize profits to cater for losses caused. Business managers maximize profits when there is a more significant gap between total revenue and cost. For example, managers can maximize profits by increasing output, inventing new products, and reducing production costs. For smooth running and maintenance of organizational objectives and goals, business managers have to develop new strategies to survive during the inflation period. Cost-push inflation reduces the purchasing power of consumers in the market. An increase in production costs leads to a relative increase in the cost of goods and services. Thus, managers have to increase the prices of their products irrespective of the lower income of consumers to save their organizations from falling.
The neoclassical theory can be applied in times of crisis that lead to cost-push inflation to pursue its goals of increasing value maximization. The neoclassical theory is established on imaginary and develops the principle of business profit maximization to maximize profits when the marginal cost is equal to the marginal revenue. Managers can use this theory when describing market structures, regulating business challenges, barriers to entry, developing strategic pricing, and improving economies of scale. Managers should be aware of reactions from other firms before deciding on maximizing profits. If other companies follow the decision of one firm to embrace profit maximization, then the demand will become elastic in the market. On the contrary, if other companies do not follow a firm's decision to maximize profits, the demand becomes elastic. Therefore, a manager should be strategic in decision-making to prevent the company from collapsing when faced with management problems.
Conclusion
Pettinger (2022) summarizes by illustrating that managers play a critical role in decision-making when crises occur that threaten the business performance and achievement of organizational goals and objectives. From the article, Pettinger illustrates the problem of increased oil prices on business management. Despite high economic struggles with lower incomes, business managers have to strategically develop ways of maintaining and ensuring the organizational goals are met through decision-making such as profit maximization, increased prizing, and production cost reduction.
