Contributing To Community Recovery
The lingering effects of natural disasters on emotional, physical and behavioral health can be enormous. According to Hettige et al. (2018), areas hit with natural disasters are characterized with increased rates of substance abuse as a coping method to the effects of the disaster. This paper focuses on community recovery efforts in a small Midwestern town that was struck by a tornado, resulting to loss of lives and destruction of properties. The management of substance abuse even after natural disasters such as tornados is important in promoting mental health and awareness.
Avchen et al. (2019) postulated that addiction treatment centers assist addicted individuals to halt compulsive seeking and use of drugs. In the event of natural disasters, addiction treatment centers may also offer stress coping mechanisms to the victims. In response to the occurrence of a tornado at a Midwestern town, I may direct my staff to set up group counselling sessions. Group counselling sessions creates camaraderie that may result to a sense of belonging among the victims. In addition, I may also advise my staff and other helping professionals to offer individual counselling services to the victims of the disaster. Counselling services offer emotional support to the victims of the disaster thus acting as a coping mechanism. Furthermore, counselling offers guidance to individuals suffering from drug addiction. I might also direct my staff and other helping professionals to offer basic needs such as food, water and shelter to the victims of the Tornado. Provision of basic needs may reduce stress among the victims as their needs are being met. Besides, provision of accommodation may act as safe place to any individual being coerced into drug addiction.
My main goal in the community recovery effort would be to reduce the overall risk of drug addiction in the community. This risk may be reduced by addressing the causes of drug use such as stress and the environment. In community recovery effort, offering emotional and mental support to the victims of the tornado would be my second goal. Sledge & Thomas (2019) postulated that stress is the leading cause of drug and substance in relations to natural disasters. As a result, the victims of the tornado will require counselling and other emotional coping mechanisms. To offer treatment of drug and substance abuse would be another goal of the community recovery center. Drug and substance abuse treatment would be done through medication or evaluation of mental health. 
According to Kopak & Van Brown (2020), federal and local government regulations might impact an addiction counselor’s ability to contribute to this community recovery. Federal laws such as the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MPHAEA) create changes that result to regulation of mental health treatment. In addition, the federal laws work to protect the right of individuals with mental health disorders, including those arising from natural disasters (Sledge & Thomas, 2019). The federal and local government regulations might also address the several issues such as treatment facilities and standards for involuntary treatment (Kopak & Van Brown, 2020). These regulations provide of guideline of what is and is not permitted under law. The federal and local government regulations might further assist in making arrests of any individuals selling drugs. Making arrests will impact an addiction counselor’s ability to contribute to this community recovery as it will cut off the supply of drugs. Furthermore, federal and local government laws provide details of programs and processes which the government provides assistance. Conversely, the ability of community of the counselor to contribute to the community will be influenced as aspects such as funding may be required.
